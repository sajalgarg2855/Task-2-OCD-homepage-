# Task-2-OCD-homepage-
Ocd homepage created with the help of HTML and CSS

Approach of My task-
Languages I used: HTML and CSS
With the help of bootstrap in css I made the navbar and footer of my homepage with some changes in them. I chose almost the same colour pallette as the official ocd website. Also for the content I referred to the ocd website.Few fonts used are aquired from google fonts. I also made a seperate about page for the website which can be accessed with the about button. In the hamburger menu, the contact button is also responsive and it takes you to the contact section of the page whenever pressed.
Entire webpage is responsive to all different sizes of screens (whether it is mobile,ipad,desktop or even a TV).
The social icons in the footer also work except for the whatsapp one.
